			<h2>Git Workflow</h2>
			<p>
			Git is crucial for team collaboration when programming. When collaborating with a group, obviously the first step for your team to do, is let the project manager create the essential git respository. From there, the project manager or whoevers in charge with the respository will share the respos. to their team so they can collaborate. Each developer should create Branches. Branches are basically the developer's version of the project. They do code strictly on their branch as it organize/doesn't mess up the origin master branch. When a developer is satisfied on their code, they can do a pull request. A pull request is basically pushing developer's branches code into th original/master which is basically where all working features should be implemented.
